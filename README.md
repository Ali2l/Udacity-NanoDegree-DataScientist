# Project Motivation

For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a Database of top 1000 movies on IMDB website found on Kaggle containing 1000  movies. 

## File Descriptions

There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.
