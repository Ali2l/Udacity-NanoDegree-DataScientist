# Project Motivation

I was interested in predicting customer churn for a music company called Sparkify. 

The goals of the project as follows: 
- Loading and cleaning a subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB).
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data.
- Feature Engineering to create features.
- Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees.

# File Descriptions

There is one exploratory jupyter notebook containing all the code.
# Medium Blog Post

You can find the Medium Blog Post [Here](https://medium.com/@ali.y.alkhowaiter/predicting-churn-using-ml-and-pyspark-134e9423562b) explaining the technical details of my project. A Random Forest Classifier was chosen to be the best model by evaluating F1 score and accuracy metrics. The final model achieved an F1 and Accuracy score of 0.82.
